# GaitSADA: Self-Aligned Domain Adaptation for mmWave Gait Recognition
mmWave radar-based gait recognition is a novel user identification method that captures human gait biometrics from mmWave radar return signals. This technology offers privacy protection and is resilient to weather and lighting conditions. However, its generalization performance is yet unknown and limits its practical deployment. To address this problem, in this paper, a non-synthetic dataset is collected and analyzed to reveal the presence of spatial and temporal domain shifts in mmWave gait biometric data, which significantly impacts identification accuracy. To address this issue, a novel self-aligned domain adaptation method called GaitSADA is proposed. GaitSADA improves system generalization performance by using a two-stage semi-supervised model training approach. The first stage uses semi-supervised contrastive learning and the second stage uses semi-supervised consistency training with centroid alignment. Extensive experiments show that GaitSADA outperforms representative domain adaptation methods by an average of 15.41% in low data regimes.
